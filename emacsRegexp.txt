\|                             Alternative
\{ \}                          Repetition

\&                             Insert whole match
\,(function)                   Call elisp function in replace portion of regexp
\w                             Word-constituent character
\W                             Not Word-constituent character
\sCODE                         Match        character from code table
\Scode                         Do not match character from code table
Code table (can change depending on major mode):
-                              Whitespace
w                              Alnum
_                              Alnum with extra symbols: _ ! and others
.                              Punctuation characters
( and )                        Grouped pair: () [] {}
"                              String characters: " '
< and >                        Open/close comment characters

Recursion:
You may want to increase the values of "max-specpdl-size" and
"max-lisp-eval-depth".  In my ".emacs" file, I set them to
15 and 30 times their default value - Elisp Intro (eintr).
